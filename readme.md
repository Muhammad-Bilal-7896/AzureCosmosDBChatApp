# AzureCosmosDBChatApp

This repository contains the step by step procedure to create a full stack chat App with Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB and Node JS on the backend and Next JS on the Front End and deploy backend to Azure.
It is written for a blog for demonstrating the Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL Capability in creating a Full Stack Chat App using Node JS and Next JS in front end.

## Current Stage
- **Azure Cosmos DB Setup** Azure Cosmos DB Setup with step by step details is done and now working on second part **BackEnd API Development of Chat App**

## The article will be divided into four parts:

- **Azure Cosmos DB Setup**: We will discuss the Azure Cosmos DB intro and setup and its benefits

- **BackEnd API Development of Chat App**: We will write our backend code using Node JS to interact with Azure Cosmos Db

- **Front-End Development of Chat App**: We will write our front-end code using the Next js framework.

- **Deployment on Microsoft Azure**: We will deploy our backend using Azure and the front end using Vercel.

### Stay tuned. Will publish the article with complete code soon in a week on my linkedin and will update the code and readme here.
